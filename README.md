# ActivityTracker
This repo is a fork of the original app created by CWayne18.

The app has been upgraded by Michele and Ernes_t to work only on 16.04 Ubuntu Touch.
Due to older QML lib on 15.04, the changes cannot be retrofitted.

Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/ernesst/ActivityTracker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of changes.
